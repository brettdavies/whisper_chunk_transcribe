# `helper_classes.py`

## Design Considerations and Enhancements

- **Data Class Simplicity**: This module uses Pythonâ€™s `dataclasses` to represent structured entities such as segments, test cases, transcriptions, and players. This approach simplifies the representation of complex data, reduces boilerplate code, and allows for easy manipulation and access to class fields.
- **Encapsulation of Experiment Data**: Classes like `ExpSegment` and `ExpTestCase` encapsulate experiment-specific data, while others like `TranscriptionWord` and `TranscriptionSegment` encapsulate transcription-related data. This structure makes it easier to manage and interact with experiment and transcription data across the system.
- **Log Integration**: By integrating `loguru`, the module allows for efficient logging to track the manipulation and status of segments, test cases, transcriptions, and other data components.

## Module Overview

The `helper_classes.py` module provides several data classes representing different components of the experiment and transcription framework, including segments, test cases, transcription words, teams, and players. Each class encapsulates specific metadata and provides utility methods where applicable.

### Key Libraries and Dependencies

- **`dataclasses`**: Provides a decorator and functions for automatically adding special methods to user-defined classes.
  - [Dataclasses Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)
- **`pathlib`**: Standard library used for manipulating filesystem paths, particularly for audio file paths in this case.

## Usage Example

Below is an example demonstrating how to use the `ExpSegment` and `ExpTestCase` classes to define a segment and a test case within an experiment:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from helper_classes import ExpSegment, ExpTestCase

# Define a segment of an experiment
segment = ExpSegment(
    segment_id=1,
    video_id="VID123",
    raw_audio_path=Path("/path/to/raw/audio.wav"),
    processed_audio_path=Path("/path/to/processed/audio.wav"),
    test_case_id=10
)

# Define a test case for an experiment
test_case = ExpTestCase(
    experiment_id=1,
    test_case_id=1001,
    prompt_template="Transcribe the following:",
    prompt_tokens=50,
    test_prompt_id=1234,
    _is_dynamic=True,  # Initialize the internal dynamic flag
    _use_prev_transcription=False  # Initialize the previous transcription flag
)

# Accessing segment attributes
print(f"Segment ID: {segment.segment_id}, Video ID: {segment.video_id}")
print(f"Raw Audio Path: {segment.raw_audio_path}, Processed Audio Path: {segment.processed_audio_path}")

# Accessing test case attributes
print(f"Experiment ID: {test_case.experiment_id}, Test Case ID: {test_case.test_case_id}")
print(f"Prompt Template: {test_case.prompt_template}, Tokens: {test_case.prompt_tokens}")

# Accessing property methods
print(f"Is dynamic: {test_case.is_dynamic}")
print(f"Uses previous transcription: {test_case.use_prev_transcription}")
```


Below is an example of how to use the `Transcription`, `TranscriptionSegment`, and `TranscriptionWord` classes to define transcription data and a game instance:

```python
from helper_classes import Transcription, TranscriptionSegment, and TranscriptionWord

# Define transcription segments and words
segment = TranscriptionSegment(
    transcribed_text="Hello, world!",
    start=0.0,
    end=2.0,
    avg_logprob=-1.23
)

word = TranscriptionWord(
    start=0.0,
    end=0.5,
    word="Hello",
    probability=0.95
)

# Create a transcription object
transcription = Transcription(
    segments=[segment],
    words=[word]
)

# Accessing transcription attributes
print(f"Transcribed text: {transcription.segments[0].transcribed_text}")
print(f"Word: {transcription.words[0].word}, Probability: {transcription.words[0].probability}")
```

Below is an example of how to use the `Game`, `Team`, and `Player` classes to define transcription data and a game instance:

```python
from helper_classes import Game, Team, Player
# Define teams and players
home_team = Team(team_id=1, display_name="Team A", abbreviation="TA")
away_team = Team(team_id=2, display_name="Team B", abbreviation="TB")

player1 = Player(player_id=1, name="Player 1", team_id=1)
player2 = Player(player_id=2, name="Player 2", team_id=2)

# Create a game instance
game = Game(
    video_id="VID123",
    espn_id=1001,
    home_team=home_team,
    away_team=away_team,
    home_players=[player1],
    away_players=[player2]
)

# Access team and player data
print(f"Home team: {game.home_team.display_name}, Away team: {game.away_team.display_name}")
print(f"Players: {game.get_upsert_players()}")
```
